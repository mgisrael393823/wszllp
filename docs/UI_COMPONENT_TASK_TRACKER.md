## üìå Development Notes

- The overall strategy is to first build the core UI components needed to view and interact with imported data, then develop advanced features.
- Document storage and user authentication are critical foundational components that should be addressed early.
- Many components have interdependencies - for example, calendar integration depends on proper hearing management components.
- Focus first on components that enable the single lawyer to effectively view and manage existing cases.
- Defer client portal and multi-user features until core functionality is complete.
