git checkout main
git checkout -b staging
git push -u origin staging
```

### Deploy Staging
1. **Vercel Staging**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy staging branch
   vercel --target staging
   ```

2. **Test Tyler Credentials**:
   - Use staging environment to test credentials
   - Verify e-filing functionality works end-to-end
   - Test error handling and edge cases

## 📊 Production Testing Plan

### 1. Authentication Testing
- [ ] Tyler Technologies authentication works
- [ ] Attorney list loads correctly
- [ ] Payment accounts retrieve successfully

### 2. E-Filing Functionality  
- [ ] Initial filing submission (new case)
- [ ] Subsequent filing submission (existing case)

- [ ] Invalid credentials show proper messages
- [ ] File validation works correctly
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid submissions

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] Application loads quickly
- [ ] File uploads perform well
- [ ] API responses are reasonable
- [ ] UI remains responsive during submissions

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

### Production Monitoring Setup
1. **Error Tracking**:
   - Set up Sentry or similar error tracking
   - Monitor e-filing submission errors
   - Track authentication failures

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor API response times
   - Track file upload performance  
   - Monitor overall application performance

3. **Usage Analytics**:
