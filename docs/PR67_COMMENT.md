# PR #67 Test Results & Recommendation

Thank you for the excellent work on centralizing the Tyler configuration! I've thoroughly tested PR #67 and found a few issues that needed to be addressed. I've implemented fixes in the `codex-efiling` branch that builds upon your improvements.

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ What Works Great:
- Tyler configuration is properly centralized
- Optional services correctly removed (fixes the API error)
- Build and TypeScript checks pass
- Filing codes are well-organized

### üîß Issues Found & Fixed:

1. **Affidavit Validation** - Was requiring affidavit for ALL case types
   - **Fixed**: Now only required for Joint Action cases (237037, 237042, 201996, 201995)
   
2. **Cross-Reference Priority** - Joint Actions always used "44113", preventing user override
   - **Fixed**: User input is now checked first, then falls back to "44113"
   
3. **Hard-Coded Values** - Phone/email were hard-coded
   - **Fixed**: Set to empty strings since form doesn't collect these fields
   
4. **Summons Processing** - Only processed first summons file
   - **Fixed**: Now processes all uploaded summons files

## Automated Test Results

All tests now pass:

## Payload Generation Tests

Verified correct behavior for all scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Joint Action without user input ‚Üí Uses "44113"
- ‚úÖ Joint Action with user input ‚Üí User value takes priority
- ‚úÖ Possession cases ‚Üí No cross-reference required
- ‚úÖ Affidavit only required for Joint Action cases

## Recommendation

I recommend closing this PR and merging the `codex-efiling` branch instead, which includes:
- All your excellent Tyler config centralization work
- The fixes for the issues identified above
- Comprehensive test coverage

The `codex-efiling` branch is ready for production with all tests passing.
