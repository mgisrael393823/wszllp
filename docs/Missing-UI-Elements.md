## Detailed Implementation Notes

### 1. Payment Plans Section

The Payment Plans section needs a complete implementation, including:

- **PaymentPlansPage.tsx**: Main container page
- **PaymentPlanList.tsx**: List view of all payment plans
- **PaymentPlanDetail.tsx**: Detailed view of individual payment plans
- Route definition in App.tsx: `<Route path="/payment-plans" element={<PaymentPlansPage />} />`
- Route definition in App.tsx: `<Route path="/payment-plans/:id" element={<PaymentPlanDetail />} />`

The PaymentPlanForm.tsx component exists but isn't integrated into a proper page flow.

### 2. Contacts Management

The Contacts section needs a complete implementation, including:

- **ContactsPage.tsx**: Main container page
- **ContactList.tsx**: List view of all contacts
- **ContactDetail.tsx**: Detailed view of individual contacts
- **ContactForm.tsx**: Form for creating/editing contacts
- Route definitions in App.tsx for all these views

This should follow the pattern of other entity management pages like Cases.

### 3. Zoom Links Management

The Zoom Links section needs implementation, including:

- **ZoomLinksPage.tsx**: Main container page
- **ZoomLinkForm.tsx**: Form for adding/editing Zoom links
- Integration with the hearings system

The calendar integration functionality needs to be completed:

- Fix the integration form in CalendarPage.tsx
- Handle the onClick for the integration button

The case creation flow needs to be completed:

- Add a route in App.tsx: `<Route path="/cases/new" element={<CaseForm />} />`

- **Settings**: System configuration options
