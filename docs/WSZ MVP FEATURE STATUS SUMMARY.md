**9. Critical Path Items**  
  
The following items appear to be the most important to complete for a
functional MVP:  
  
1. **Document Upload & Storage**: Implement secure file storage to
handle actual documents  
2. **Calendar Integration**: Complete external calendar syncing for
hearings  
3. **User Authentication**: Add multi-user support with roles and
permissions  
4. **Document Generation**: Finish template-based document creation
system  
5. **Payment Processing**: Implement invoice payment functionality  
  
**10. Summary Recommendations**  
  
1. **Prioritize Core Workflows**: Focus on completing the document
management and calendar integration  
features, which appear to be the most important incomplete parts of core
workflows  
2. **Build Missing Integrations**: The application needs proper
integrations with:  
- External calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook)  
- Payment processors  
- Court e-filing systems  
- Cloud storage for documents  
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Several areas would benefit from UX
improvements:  
- More robust notification system  
- Enhanced dashboard with key metrics  
- Batch operations for common tasks  
- Mobile optimization  
4. **Address Technical Debt**: The current localStorage-based data
persistence should be replaced with a  
proper backend when moving beyond the MVP stage  
5. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation to assist
with adoption and training  
  
The application has a solid foundation with many functional features but
requires strategic completion of  
several partially-implemented capabilities to deliver a complete
solution for legal case management.
