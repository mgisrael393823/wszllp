# E-Filing Implementation Strategy

## Codebase Analysis

The repository uses React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a custom component system. The main README outlines the technology stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Context API, and custom components.

The project structure is described with components grouped by feature area and utilities for data import, context, and types.

Design tokens and core UI patterns are defined in the design system documentation.

E‑filing integration docs summarize the intended API usage and note that integration code will live in src/components/efile/ and src/utils/efile/.

The e‑filing API uses a POST /v4/il/user/authenticate call with a clienttoken header to obtain an auth_token. Filings are submitted via POST /v4/il/efile and status is retrieved from GET /v4/il/envelope/{id}.

The codebase currently has a placeholder EFilePage component that accepts user input, but no actual API calls; it simply shows "Batch eFiling" and a link to the docs.

State management relies on a single DataProvider that stores all entities in local storage and uses a custom reducer for updates. A refine-style data provider is implemented for contacts as an example of API integration.

No dedicated authentication code exists in src/; login is not yet implemented (grep returns no matches).

Upcoming project phases indicate that e‑filing integration is part of "Phase 3: Optimization and Integration"

## 1. Implementation Strategy

### New Components

- **EFileSubmissionForm** (src/components/efile/EFileSubmissionForm.tsx): A form to capture case metadata, parties, and documents, replacing the placeholder fields in EFilePage.

- **EFileStatusList** (src/components/efile/EFileStatusList.tsx): Displays submission history and current status for each envelope.

- **EFileUploadItem** (src/components/efile/EFileUploadItem.tsx): Handles file validation (PDF/DOCX, size limit) and base64 conversion before submission.

- **EFileProvider / eFiling context** (src/context/EFileContext.tsx): Manages auth token, submission progress, and status polling, using the existing reducer pattern.

### State Management

Extend the main reducer or create a dedicated efile slice that stores:

- authToken and expiration time.
- A list of envelopes with status (submitting, submitted, error, etc.).
- Mappings from case IDs to envelope IDs.

### Existing Component Modifications

- EFilePage will use EFileSubmissionForm and EFileStatusList.
- Add navigation badges or notifications to reflect filing status.

### Data Flow Overview

#### Login / Token Retrieval

- On first e‑filing action, call /v4/il/user/authenticate with stored client token and user credentials.
- Save auth_token in EFileContext and persist to local storage for reuse until expiration.

#### Prepare Submission

- User selects a case and uploads required documents.
- Files are converted to base64 by EFileUploadItem and inserted into the JSON payload following the API's structure.

#### Submit Filing

- POST to /v4/il/efile with the authtoken header.
- Store returned envelope_id and set status to submitting.

#### Poll for Status

- Periodically call /v4/il/envelope/{id} until the filing status changes from submitting to submitted or error.
- Update local state and notify users through the notification system.

#### Reference Data

- Retrieve payment accounts and firm attorneys via the reference endpoints before the first submission to populate dropdowns.

### UI Mockup Description

- **Submission Form**: Step‑by‑step wizard or a single card with grouped fields (case details, parties, documents). Use existing Input, Select, and Card components.
- **Status List**: Table listing envelope ID, case number, filing date, and status. Each row links to more details or a download of stamped documents.

## 2. Technical Recommendations

### Libraries / Dependencies

- **axios** for HTTP calls (fits typical React patterns).
- **react-query** or **@tanstack/react-query** for managing async requests and caching.
- **zod** or existing schema definitions to validate e‑filing payloads before submission.
- Optional: **jszip** or **pdf-lib** if document manipulation/compression is required.

### Authentication Handling

- Store the client token from configuration (e.g., env variable).
- Exchange username/password for auth_token on demand.
- Persist auth_token in local storage with expiration check; refresh when needed.

### File Handling

- Use the browser FileReader API to convert uploads to base64.
- Enforce PDF/DOCX type and size (<10 MB as suggested in the form placeholder) before encoding.

### Error Handling & Feedback

- Map API message_code or HTTP errors to user-friendly messages.
- Display inline errors on the form, with a summary toast for failures.
- Log unsuccessful submissions to the audit log via DataContext.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API failures, particularly for status checking.

### Testing Approach

- Unit test utility functions (authentication, payload building).
- Component tests for the form using React Testing Library.
- Mock API responses to simulate success, validation errors, and network failures.
- End-to-end flows (e.g., with Cypress) for submission and status tracking.
- **Mock Strategy**: Create a detailed mock server for development that simulates various API response scenarios including edge cases.

## 3. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Foundation

- Create EFileContext with auth token management.
- Implement utilities in src/utils/efile for:
  - Authentication (POST /authenticate).
  - File encoding and payload construction.
  - Status polling.
- Replace EFilePage with modular components and connect to context.

### Phase 2 – Submission & Status Tracking

- Integrate form with case selection.
- Use React Query to send submissions and poll for status.
- Update the reducer to store envelope records.
- Add UI notifications via existing NotificationBell.

### Phase 3 – Refinement

- Add error retry logic and automatic token refresh.
- Implement audit logging and downloadable stamped document links.
- Expand permission checks (only authorized users can e-file).
- Write unit and integration tests.
- **Offline Support**: Add capability to save draft submissions locally if connectivity is lost during form completion.
- **User Permissions**: Integrate with existing role-based permissions to control who can submit e-filings.
- **Logging and Audit**: Implement comprehensive logging for all API interactions to support troubleshooting and compliance.

### Dependencies & Prerequisites

- Ensure environment variables are available for client token and credentials.
- Document storage must support retrieval of uploaded PDFs/DOCX.

### Configuration
• Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) from `.env.example` with:
  - `VITE_EFILE_BASE_URL=<your base URL>`
  - `VITE_EFILE_CLIENT_TOKEN=<your client token>`
• Restart the dev server after any change.
• The system will automatically fall back to `process.env.VITE_EFILE_CLIENT_TOKEN` when running in Node environments (e.g., during tests), allowing for consistent configuration across all execution contexts.

### CI/CD Integration
• GitHub Actions runs `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` on every PR.  
• Protect the `main` branch by requiring passing checks before merge.

### Design Patterns
• See `/docs/design-tokens.md` for color, spacing, and typography guidelines.  
• Follow the component folder convention: each component lives in its own directory with:
  - `ComponentName.tsx`
  - `ComponentName.test.tsx`
  - `ComponentName.module.css` or Tailwind classes.

### Third-Party Dependencies
We will consume:
- `axios`
- `@tanstack/react-query`
- `zod`
- `idb-keyval` (for offline drafts)
- `msw` (for API mocks)

### Security Considerations
• Never commit real credentials—use a backend proxy if you must protect secrets.  
• Implement token expiration handling and automatic refresh or logout.  
• Ensure all API calls occur over HTTPS.

### Potential Challenges

- Handling large file uploads in the browser (consider chunked uploads if API supports).
- Mapping complex case data to required party structures.
- Keeping auth tokens secure; might require a proxy backend if credentials should not be exposed.

## 4. Questions for the API Provider

1. **Token Lifecycle**: How long does the auth_token remain valid? Is token refresh supported?
2. **Rate Limits**: Are there request limits per minute/day for authentication or e‑file submission?
3. **File Constraints**: What are the exact file type and size restrictions? Are multi-file envelopes allowed?
4. **Error Codes**: Is there a list of standard message_code values and their meanings?
5. **Webhook Support**: Does the API provide callbacks/webhooks when filings are accepted or rejected, or must we poll?
6. **Batch Program**: The docs mention a batch program option. How does it differ from direct API calls?
7. **Staging Environment**: Are there separate credentials or endpoints for testing versus production?
8. **Payment Handling**: Are there sandbox payment accounts for staging? What validation occurs on payment info?

## Summary

The codebase uses React with a Context-based state management system and a custom Tailwind-powered component library. The project structure organizes components by feature areas and includes utilities for data import and context management.

E‑filing integration docs specify authentication, submission, status, and reference endpoints.

The current EFilePage is a static form without real API calls, and integration utilities under src/utils/efile are yet to be created.

Implementing e‑filing requires new React components, context management for authentication/status tracking, and utility modules for API calls and file handling. It is recommended to use libraries like axios and React Query for network operations, and to follow the design system's guidelines for UI consistency.

Testing will involve unit tests for utilities, component tests for forms, and integration tests using mocked API responses. Potential challenges include token management, handling large files, and mapping existing case data into the API's required structure.
