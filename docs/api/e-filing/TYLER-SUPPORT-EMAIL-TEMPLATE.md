**RE:** E-Filing API Integration - Credential Verification Required

---

### Request Summary
We are implementing e-filing integration for our case management system and need to verify our API credentials. Our current credentials are returning authentication errors, and we need confirmation of the correct values.

### Account Information
- **Firm:** Wolf, Solvoy & Associates LLP
- **Contact:** Charles Zivin (czivin@wolfsolovy.com)
- **Service:** E-Filing API Integration
- **API Endpoint:** https://api.uslegalpro.com/v4

### Current Credentials (Need Verification)
- **Client Token:** EVICT87
- **Username:** czivin@wolfsolovy.com
- **Password:** [Current password on file]

### Error Details
When attempting authentication, we receive:
```
HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
{
  "message_code": -4,
  "message": "Authentication failed, invalid/expired authentication token or email/password combination"
}
```

### Questions Requiring Clarification

1. **Credential Verification:**
   - Is the client token "EVICT87" correct for our account?
   - Is the username "czivin@wolfsolovy.com" properly configured?
   - Has the password expired or been changed?
   - Is our account active and properly configured for API access?

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Are these staging or production credentials?
   - Is "https://api.uslegalpro.com/v4" the correct API endpoint?
   - Do we need separate credentials for testing vs production?

3. **Account Configuration:**
   - Are e-filing permissions enabled for our account?
   - Are attorney and payment account records properly set up?
   - Are there any account restrictions or additional setup requirements?

4. **API Access:**
   - Are we configured for Illinois (IL) e-filing specifically?
   - Do we have access to Cook County (cook:cvd1) jurisdiction?
   - Are there any IP restrictions or firewall requirements?

### Technical Implementation Status

### Preferred Response
Please provide:
1. **Verified credentials** (client token, username, password)
2. **Correct API endpoint** for our environment
3. **Confirmation** of account setup and permissions
4. **Any additional setup requirements** we may have missed
