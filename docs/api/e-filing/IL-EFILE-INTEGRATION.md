# Illinois E-Filing Integration

This document outlines the minimum required APIs to file a petition in Illinois using the e-filing system.

## Integration Flow

The basic workflow consists of three primary steps:

1. **Authentication** - Login to the e-filing system
2. **Submission** - Submit e-filing using JSON payload
3. **Status Check** - Check the status of submitted filings

## API Endpoints

When the API documentation is received, details for each endpoint will be documented here:

### 1. Authentication API

_Authentication details to be added when documentation is received_

### 2. E-Filing Submission API

_Details on JSON payload format and submission endpoints to be added when documentation is received_

### 3. Status Check API

_Details on checking filing status to be added when documentation is received_

## Batch Processing Option

The contact has also mentioned availability of a batch program that other attorneys use. This could be an alternative to direct API integration and may be worth exploring if it provides a simpler integration path.

## Implementation Considerations

- Data mapping between WSZLLP case management system and the required e-filing JSON format
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Secure credential storage
- Logging and audit trail of filing activities
- User notification system for filing status updates

## Next Steps

1. Review full API documentation when received
2. Request more information about the batch program option
3. Evaluate both direct API integration and batch program approaches
4. Create a technical implementation plan
5. Develop integration with appropriate error handling and logging
