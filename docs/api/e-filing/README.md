# E-Filing API Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the e-filing integration API and related resources.

## Documentation Files

- [`OFFICIAL-API-DOCUMENTATION-WITH-CREDENTIALS.txt`](./OFFICIAL-API-DOCUMENTATION-WITH-CREDENTIALS.txt) - Original API documentation from the provider with client token and stage credentials
- [`API-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`](./API-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) - Structured documentation of API endpoints, authentication flow, and data formats
- [`IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION-STRATEGY.md) - Technical implementation plan with component architecture, roadmap, and technical requirements

## Integration Plan

The e-filing integration will allow the WSZLLP application to directly submit court filings electronically, which aligns with PRD section 6.3 Integration requirements.

## Sample Documents

The [`/samples`](./samples/) folder contains template documents that will be used for e-filing submissions:

- [`eviction_complaint_template.pdf`](./samples/eviction_complaint_template.pdf) - Standard eviction complaint template that will be filled with case-specific information before submission
- [`eviction_summons_template.pdf`](./samples/eviction_summons_template.pdf) - Standard eviction summons template that will be filled with defendant information before submission

These templates represent the base documents that will be consistently uploaded as part of the e-filing process. In real-world implementations, these templates will be populated with the necessary case data, plaintiff/defendant information, and specific eviction details before submission.

The implementation will need to either:
1. Generate completed PDFs from these templates with form field data, or
2. Submit these templates along with the required JSON data for the court system to merge

## Implementation Files

Implementation files can be found in:
- `/src/components/e-filing/` - Frontend components for e-filing
- `/src/utils/e-filing/` - Utility functions for e-filing integration
- `/src/mocks/fixtures/e-filing/` - Mock data for development and testing

## Implementation Phases

As outlined in the implementation strategy document:

1. **Phase 1 – Foundation**
   - Authentication and token management
   - Core utility functions
   - Base component structure

2. **Phase 2 – Submission & Status Tracking**
   - Form integration with case selection
   - API integration with React Query
   - Status tracking and notifications

3. **Phase 3 – Refinement**
   - Error handling with retry logic
   - Audit logging
   - Permission controls
   - Testing
