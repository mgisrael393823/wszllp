## Integration Plan

The e-filing integration will allow the WSZLLP application to directly submit court filings electronically, which aligns with PRD section 6.3 Integration requirements.

## Sample Documents

The `/samples` folder contains template documents that will be used for e-filing submissions:

- `eviction_complaint_template.pdf` - Standard eviction complaint template that will be filled with case-specific information before submission
- `eviction_summons_template.pdf` - Standard eviction summons template that will be filled with defendant information before submission

These templates represent the base documents that will be consistently uploaded as part of the e-filing process. In real-world implementations, these templates will be populated with the necessary case data, plaintiff/defendant information, and specific eviction details before submission.

The implementation will need to either:
1. Generate completed PDFs from these templates with form field data, or
2. Submit these templates along with the required JSON data for the court system to merge
