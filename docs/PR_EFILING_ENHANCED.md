# Enhanced E-Filing Integration with Tyler API

## Summary

This PR enhances the e-filing integration by centralizing Tyler API configuration and fixing critical validation issues. It builds upon the work in PR #67 while addressing several bugs that were preventing proper e-filing submissions.

## Changes

### 1. Centralized Tyler Configuration
- Created `/src/config/tyler-api.ts` with all Tyler-specific constants
- Removed hard-coded values throughout the codebase
- Improved maintainability and configuration management

### 2. Fixed Affidavit Validation
- **Before**: Required affidavit for ALL case types
- **After**: Only required for Joint Action cases (237037, 237042, 201996, 201995)
- Possession cases no longer incorrectly require affidavits

### 3. Fixed Cross-Reference Logic
- **Before**: Joint Actions always forced "44113", preventing user overrides
- **After**: User input is checked first, with "44113" as fallback
- Maintains Tyler requirements while allowing flexibility

### 4. Removed Hard-Coded Contact Info
- **Before**: Hard-coded phone/email values in case parties
- **After**: Empty strings (form doesn't collect these fields)
- Prevents submission of incorrect contact information

### 5. Enhanced Summons Processing
- **Before**: Only processed first summons file
- **After**: Processes all uploaded summons files
- Supports multiple defendants with individual summons

## Testing

Comprehensive automated tests confirm all functionality:

```bash
# Run validation tests
node scripts/test-efiling-fixes.js
# Result: ✅ All tests passed (6/6)

# Run payload generation tests  
node scripts/test-efiling-payload-generation.js
# Result: ✅ All scenarios passed (12/12)
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Tyler config properly imported and used
- ✅ Affidavit only required for Joint Action cases
- ✅ User cross-reference input takes priority
- ✅ "44113" used as fallback for Joint Actions
- ✅ No hard-coded phone/email values
- ✅ Multiple summons file support

## Impact

These changes ensure:
1. **Compliance**: Meets Tyler API requirements while maintaining flexibility
2. **User Experience**: Doesn't force unnecessary document uploads
3. **Data Integrity**: Prevents submission of incorrect data
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration for easier updates
