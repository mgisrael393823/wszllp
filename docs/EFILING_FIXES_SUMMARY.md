# E-Filing Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved all e-filing issues with Tyler API integration. The system now properly handles all case types with correct validation and user-friendly defaults.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ "Invalid documentoptionalservicecode" Error
- **Problem**: Optional services code "282616" was rejected by Tyler API
- **Solution**: Removed optional_services from payload entirely
- **Status**: Fixed and deployed

### 2. ✅ Cross-Reference for Joint Actions
- **Problem**: Joint Action cases require attorney number "44113"
- **Solution**: Implemented smart fallback logic:
  - User input takes priority (if provided)
  - Falls back to "44113" for Joint Actions
  - No cross-reference for Possession cases
- **Status**: Fixed and deployed

### 3. ✅ Affidavit Requirements
- **Problem**: Affidavit was required for Joint Action cases only
- **Solution**: Made affidavit optional for ALL case types
- **Status**: Fixed and deployed (PR #69)

### 4. ✅ Multiple Summons Support
- **Problem**: Only first summons file was processed
- **Solution**: Now processes all uploaded summons files
- **Status**: Fixed and deployed

### 5. ✅ Configuration Management
- **Problem**: Tyler API values hard-coded throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Centralized in `/src/config/tyler-api.ts`
- **Status**: Implemented and deployed
