# Data Import Directory

This directory is for uploading spreadsheet data that will be imported into the WSZLLP platform.

## Instructions

1. Place your Excel (.xlsx), CSV, or Google Sheets export files in this directory
2. Ensure the spreadsheet contains all necessary data (clients, cases, hearings, etc.)
3. Maintain the original column headers as they'll be used for mapping data
4. If you have multiple spreadsheets, please add them all to this directory

## Data Security Note

This directory contains sensitive client information. Please ensure:
- No unnecessary copies are made
- Files are deleted after successful import
- Access to this directory is restricted

## Next Steps

After uploading your spreadsheet(s), we'll:
1. Analyze the data structure
2. Create a mapping between spreadsheet columns and database fields
3. Develop an import script to populate the application
4. Verify data integrity before deploying to production
