# E-Filing Status Enhancement

## What's New

The e-filing status list on the E-Filing page now includes:

1. **Recent Filings Display** - Shows only the last 10 filings for better focus
2. **External Filing Tracking** - Add envelope IDs from filings made outside this system
3. **Persistent Storage** - External filing IDs are saved in localStorage

## How to Use

### Track External Filings

1. Navigate to **Documents â†’ eFiling**
2. In the **Filing Status** section, click **"Track External Filing"**
3. Enter the envelope ID from Tyler's system
4. Click **"Add Filing"**

The system will:
- Add the envelope ID to your tracking list
- Automatically check its status using your Tyler credentials
- Display it alongside filings made through this dashboard

### Requirements

- You must be authenticated with Tyler (happens automatically when you use the e-filing form)
- You must have access rights to view the external filing with your credentials

### Technical Details

- External envelope IDs are stored in `localStorage` under `efile_external_envelopes`
- The list shows the 10 most recent filings (both internal and external)
- External filings are marked with an "External" badge
- Status checking uses the existing `EFileStatusItem` component

## Benefits

- Track ALL your firm's e-filings in one place
- No need to log into Tyler's portal separately
- See status updates for filings made by other attorneys in your firm
- Monitor filings made through other systems or directly via Tyler
