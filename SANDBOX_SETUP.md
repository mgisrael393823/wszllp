# Sandbox Environment Setup

This document outlines how to set up and use the sandbox environment for demonstrations with Tyler Technologies or other external parties.

## Overview

The sandbox environment provides a completely isolated demo experience with:
- Realistic sample data (cases, contacts, documents, hearings)
- All application functionality working with demo data
- Clear visual indicators when in demo mode
- Zero access to production data

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Database Migration

Run the sandbox environment migration:
```bash
# Apply the migration to create sandbox tables and RLS policies
npm run migration:apply
# OR manually run the migration file in Supabase Dashboard
```

### 2. Create Demo User Account

In Supabase Auth Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > Users
2. Click "Create new user"
3. Set:
   - **Email**: `evictionsandbox@gmail.com`
   - **Password**: `SandboxDemo2024!`
   - **Email Confirmed**: âœ… (check the box)

### 3. Update Demo Data User IDs

After creating the user, get their UUID and update demo data:
```sql
-- Get the sandbox user ID
SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'evictionsandbox@gmail.com';

-- Update demo data with the correct user_id
UPDATE sandbox_cases SET user_id = '<USER_UUID_HERE>';
UPDATE sandbox_contacts SET user_id = '<USER_UUID_HERE>';
UPDATE sandbox_documents SET user_id = '<USER_UUID_HERE>';
UPDATE sandbox_hearings SET user_id = '<USER_UUID_HERE>';
```

## Demo Credentials

**For Tyler Technologies Demo:**
- **Email**: `evictionsandbox@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `SandboxDemo2024!`
- **Environment**: Completely isolated sandbox with demo data
